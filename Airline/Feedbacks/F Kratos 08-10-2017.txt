KRATOS : I do not need your help, Zeus! I can take down this beast!
ZEUS   : I offer you more than help, Kratos. I offer you, Power. I 
         I offer you, the Blade of Olympus. It was this Blade, that 
         ended the Great War and Defeated the Titans! Drain your Godly 
         Powers into the Sword, Kratos. Only then, you will be able to
         gain you full potential power...
KRATOS : Why do you aid me, Now?
ZEUS   : What I do now, I do for the sake of all Olympus...
